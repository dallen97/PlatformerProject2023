# PlatformerProject2023

This project was created in the spring semester of 2023 for COP 3003 Programming 2 at FGCU. As the name states this is an attempt at creating a platforming game containing one level. This project will include the following in its final version: Player control, collision, platforms, player and terrain sprites, an end goal, and final message to the player/user.
